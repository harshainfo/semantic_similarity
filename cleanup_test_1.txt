You look as glum as a glum good night-cap. Don't you feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive all the same, my dear good Amédée!good morning everyone. are you feeling well now? some men are poor while some men are rich. few doctors and engineers are poor. good sportsmen are active and energetic.I am a sick man. I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased.
However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for certain what ails me.
However my disease ails me.
